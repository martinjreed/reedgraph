# A collection of useful graph routines for R

This is an eclectic mix of graph routines that I have written, some in collaboration with
PhD students of mine.

Some of the routines have been tested very well, some have not. At this stage
it is not clear from the code which routines fall under the good/bad category. But
very roughly those in reedgraph-algorithms.R are better tested and those
in reedgraph-scratch.R are very poorly tested, or are quick hacks.
